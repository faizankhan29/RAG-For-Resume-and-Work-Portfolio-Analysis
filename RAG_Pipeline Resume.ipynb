    "1. Basic RAG Pipeline:\n",
    "    - Basic Indexing of Documents using LlamaIndex.\n",
    "    - Querying from the Created Index.\n",
    "2. Advanced RAG Pipeline - Sentence Window Retrieval:\n",
    "    - Creating Sentence Window Based Index (Breaks down documents into smaller chunks like sentences).\n",
    "    - Querying most relevant chunks along with surrounding context.\n",

    "3. Advanced RAG Pipeline - Auto-merging retrieval:\n",
    "    - Creating Automerging Retrieval Based Index.\n",
    "    - Querying using auto-merging retrieval which merges information from multiple sources or segments of text to create a more comprehensive and contextually relevant response to a query"
